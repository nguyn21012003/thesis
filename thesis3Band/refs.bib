We illustrate a method of calculating similar spectra for finite lattices in a magnetic field, using methods that consider the appropriate molecular orbitals, and find that the spectra resemble the Hofstadter butterfly. We relate the bonding and antibonding orbitals used to describe small systems to the Landau levels of the infinite system. This approach provides an unusual, but instructive, method of introducing the physics of Landau levels from the basic quantum mechanics of small systems.},

	magnetic fields: quantum Hall effects and Hofstadter butterflies},
	journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
	abstract = {We consider the tight-binding models of electrons on a two-dimensional triangular lattice and kagomé lattice under staggered modulated magnetic fields. Such fields have two components: a uniform-flux part with strength ϕ, and a staggered-flux part with strength Δϕ. Various properties of the Hall conductances and Hofstadter butterflies are studied. When ϕ is fixed, variation of Δϕ  leads to the quantum Hall transitions and Chern numbers of Landau subbands being redistributed between neighboring pairs. The energy spectra with nonzero Δϕs have similar fractal structures but quite different energy gaps compared with the original Hofstadter butterflies of Δϕ = 0. Moreover, the fan-like structure of Landau levels in the low magnetic field region is also modified appreciably by Δϕ.}
